As Kirschenbaum, Alvarado, and Ramsay have variously argued, the digital humanities draw from a number of established disciplines and research methods. This is a terrible idea. Digital humanities research attempts to combine two things that are fundamentally incompatible: the sciences and the humanities. Empirical or scientific approaches believe in objective facts that stand on their own; humanities approaches believe that all truth exists from a subjective, human perspective. These two approaches are fundamentally at odds with each other, and they can never be combined. Give it up, dh!  

 

“Let’s be honest—there is no definition of digital humanities”, Rafael Alvarado states in his article. It is not necessarily a terrible idea that Digital Humanities draws from a number of established disciplines. Digital Humanities is a relatively new field, and as a result it doesn’t have the same well-established foundations that other practices have. As a result, Digital Humanities must draw on the fields that came before it in order to delineate and define what the field actually is. One could also argue that the combination of The Sciences and Humanities must lean on one another to establish parameters of the Digital Humanities field.  

Kirschenbaum mentions Voyeur, which is a system that parses texts. It examines text and analyzes it. Voyeur, which appears to contain Voyant, takes a body of text, or a corpus, and counts how many times each word is used (Kirschenbaum, 2012). Voyeur takes this information and produces different visual representations, such as graphs, using the most frequently occurring words from the given text (Voyeurtools, 2018). These visuals can be used to examine and visualize patterns and relationships in the given texts. The Voyeur software, like other software, is objective as it is coded, while the text portion could be considered either subjective or objective. Any programs that have been developed to analyze text had to be developed in an objective, scientific, manner since coding and programming is itself a science. Meanwhile the program being developed is intended for subjective use. Being able to see large bodies of text at a distance can allow scholars to make new discoveries and theories about the text(s) they have chosen to look at. This merging of Computer Sciences and The Humanities had made new methods of analysis possible. Michael Marcinkowski states in his article for Digital Humanities Quarterly “...advances in computational technique have made new modes of literary analysis viable in regard to a wider set of questions...” (Marcinkowski, 2018).  

One could also argue that since digital humanities has a methodology and methodology is essential to scientific studies. As Kirschenbaum quotes in his article “It is methodological by nature and interdisciplinary in scope. It involves investigation, analysis, synthesis and presentation of information in electronic form” (Kirschenbaum, 2012). Digital Humanities is, by nature, a marrying of a subjective and an objective field; The Humanities and Computer Sciences.  

There are professional writings and academic works from people well-known and well-respected in the field. The University of Victoria even hosts a summer institute to train new scholars in this field (Kirshenbaum, 2012). There are digital humanities centers and institutes worldwide “there are digital humanities centers and institutes (probably at least one hundred worldwide, some of them established for a decade or more with staffs numbering in the dozens)” (Kirschenbaum, 2012). This proves that Digital Humanities is not simply a flash in the pan. There is enough evidence that exists for the Digital Humanities field to be studied.  

In conclusion Digital Humanities is, as Kirschenbaum said, “alive and well” (Kirschenbaum, 2012). If Digital Humanities could not combine two fields that were “fundamentally at odds with each other”, then there is no way Digital Humanities would have made it as far as it has. Even though it appears that one could not combine an objective and a subjective field, Digital Humanities does so, and does so well. Digital Humanities uses objective data and pulls subjective information from it and vice versa.
